Models used in this exercise: 
- Multiclassification
- Random Forest Classifier
- Multilayer Perceptron Classifier

After balancing the models, it was found that we can accurately predict thyroid cancer that is high risk.
However, we fail to have a similar outcome for low and medium risk.

Future consideration is to first determine the difference between low, medium and high risk of thyroid cancer. 
Second, after assessing the definition with business, we should consider combining low and medium risk.
